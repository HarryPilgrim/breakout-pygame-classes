# breakout-pygame-classes
this is a game of breakout, made using Pygame. It utilises OOP and classes for the separate objects in the game. It records your high score in a text file, saved for when you play it again.

#how to run game

simply download the repository and run "main", you will need to import Pygame first.

#what I learnt

this project helped me to  understand classes and OOP programming a lot more. How useful it is to tidy up the code (keep code looking neat), and how it makes finding problems and bugs easier (everything is seperated).

#what I plan to improve

-replaying by pressing the space bar is not working, so you need to close out of the program and re-open it.

-create different levels, with different speeds and reduced paddle size.

-experiment with paddle physics, would like if where you hit it on the paddle would affect the direction of the ball (e.g. if you hit the ball on the left-most point of the paddle, the ball should go sharply to the left)
